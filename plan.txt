WORDLER PLAN:

1. Implement a solution only using entropy as criteria for choosing words
2. Run simulations to calculate average guesses to go depending on remaining words -> critera for guess word in or out of wordlist
    -> think if it's necessary: entropy already considers choosing the correct word
3. Implement GUI using pygame
